# fraud-detection
An overview of analyzing event submission data, and building models for detecting which submissions are fraudulent.

In the iPython notebook, I analyze event submission data to look for correlations between features and events labeled as fraud. I also do feature engineering and build a Random Forest classifier and an AdaBoost classifier and compare the results.

Note: The data set used is not public, so I have not included the data set in the repo. Also, I do not show a sample of the data in the analysis for this reason.
