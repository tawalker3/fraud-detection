# fraud-detection
An overview of analyzing event submission data, and building models for detecting which submissions are fraudulent.

In the iPython notebook, I analyze event submission data to look for correlations between features and events labeled as fraud. I also do feature engineering and build a Random Forest classifier and an AdaBoost classifier and compare the results.
